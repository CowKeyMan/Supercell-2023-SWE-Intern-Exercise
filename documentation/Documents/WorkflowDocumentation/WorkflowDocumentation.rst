Workflow Documentation
======================

This part of the documentation describes the workflow documentation, which is how to work with the repository in terms of writing code, building, running, testing, generating code coverage, building documenation and viewing the built code coverage and documentation. It is recommended to start from the :ref:`Getting Started` page right after going through the installation instructions for the :ref:`Tools` section, and then going through the :ref:`Workflow Files` to get a better understanding of the contents of the repository.
