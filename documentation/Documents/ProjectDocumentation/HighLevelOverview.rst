High Level Overview
===================

Here it is a good idea to provide a developers with a diagram of the most important components and how each of them connects to one another to form a cohesive whole, then describe that diagram with text to explain what each component does and its significance the code base. Mention the order in which steps in the pipeline are executed. If there are any complex part of the pipeline, it would be a good idea to explain it separately as if it were another program, that is, make another visualisation of its parts and explain those parts as well.
